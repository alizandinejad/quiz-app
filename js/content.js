    explanation: 'At first he first appears to be a bloodthirsty nightmare, but he is really just misunderstood. Scary Terry was very self-conscious about how scary he was and feared that he may not be terrifying enough to scare people, so he put a lot of pressure on himself because of that. This made him very tense and touchy, until Rick and Morty entered his dreams and made him feel better.'
